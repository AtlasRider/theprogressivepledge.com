        <div class="container">
            <p>Hello everyone,</p>
            <p>May I be so bold as to ask for my country back?</p>
            <p>I have a plan.</p>
            <p>I hope you will consider it.</p>
            <p>First, in the next midterm election, we vote in all of the House of Representatives and a third of the Senators on condition that they take the PLEDGE.</p>
            <br> 
            <p>The Progressive Pledge</p>
            <p>I pledge to support:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A single payer (government) health system for everyone in our country.  We consider this a right, not a privilege.</li>
                <li>Free education for everyone in our country from pre-school to graduate school.  Also, a reasonable easement of the present education debt.</li>
                <li>Tax reform that is progressive.  It will shift the tax burden away from the middle class and onto the high income earners.  It will increase taxes on speculation, on capital gains and on wealth accumulation.</li>
                <li>Banks need to be strongly regulated.  We need to go beyond Dodd-Franks.</li>
                <li>Campaign finance reform.  Money is not free speech, free speech is not money.</li>
                <li>A clear recognition of global warming and its human causes.  Create a plan with other countries to reverse this devastating condition.</li>
                <li>Infrastructure spending sufficient to get our country back in shape.</li>
                <li>A minimum hourly wage of $15.00 with annual increments going forward.  Also, a maximum wage (i.e. 40 or 50 times the minimum wage). Any wages (bonus, golden parachutes, etc.) over the maximum will be heavily taxed, both to the individual and to the corporation (Is anyone really worth $80,000,000 a year?).</li>
                <li>We need energy sources that stop polluting and don’t require United States military policing the world to protect someone else’s oil fields.  Renewable energy sources are attainable and our government should shape policy with taxes and spending to make it a reality.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We do not have time to start a third party in this country.  We need to take over the Democratic Party now.  Every Democratic House and Senate member who fails to take the PLEDGE will face a primary contender who WILL take the PLEDGE.</p>
            <p>Let’s go!</p>
